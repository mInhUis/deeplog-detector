"""DeepLog anomaly detection via top-k next-key prediction.

**Why top-k instead of a fixed threshold?**
DeepLog's core insight is that the LSTM learns a *probability distribution*
over the next log key.  Rather than thresholding a continuous score (which
requires careful calibration), the top-k approach asks a simpler question:
"Is the observed next key among the k most likely keys?"  This is robust
because:
    1. Normal sequences have low entropy — the true key almost always
       lands in a small candidate set (k = 5–10 suffices empirically).
    2. Anomalous events (e.g., a ``CreateUser`` after a ``ListBuckets``)
       produce transitions the model has never seen, pushing them far
       outside the top-k set.
    3. ``k`` is the *only* tuning knob, and it has an intuitive
       interpretation: higher k = fewer false positives, lower recall.

Evaluation (Advisor Skill 4 — Imbalanced Metric Focus):
    Cloud anomalies are extremely rare events.  Raw accuracy is misleading
    (a model predicting "normal" for everything achieves >99% accuracy).
    ``evaluate_predictions`` therefore reports **Precision, Recall, and F1**
    as the primary metrics, with accuracy included only for completeness.

Data Flow:
    Trained DeepLogModel + test log-key sessions
        → detect_anomalies()   → per-event bool flags
        → evaluate_predictions() → Precision / Recall / F1 dict

    For each session the first ``window_size`` events are unpredictable
    (no full window exists yet) and are always marked **False** (normal).
    From position ``window_size`` onward, the model predicts the next key
    from the preceding window; if the true key is *not* in the top-k
    predictions, the event is flagged as anomalous.
